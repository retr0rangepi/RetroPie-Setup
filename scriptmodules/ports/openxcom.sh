rp_module_help="Be sure to install your original data files to the proper folders in $md_inst/share/openxcom/. Game requires a mouse or xboxdrv to allow your controller to emulate a mouse. Because this uses X, you may find that the game is small in the middle of the screen. Use the Runcommand option to set the resolution to 720x480 16:9 or similarly smaller sizes. This will allow you to control the game as the window will have focus and also fill up more of the screen."
